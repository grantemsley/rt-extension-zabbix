NAME
    RT::Extension::Zabbix - Merge and resolve Zabbix tickets

DESCRIPTION
    Zabbix is a monitoring system. It's email alerts can be piped to request
    tracker. This extension automatically merges and resolves issues when it
    receives the OK alert.

ZABBIX SETUP
    Notifications need to be setup to go from zabbix to your request tracker
    queue.

    The emails from Zabbix must have the default subject line of:
    {TRIGGER.STATUS}: {TRIGGER.NAME}

    If the subject line is changed, this extension won't be able to match
    them.

    The body of the email must also contain: Host: {HOST.NAME}

    The combination of {TRIGGER.NAME} in the subject and {HOST.NAME} in the
    body will be used to uniquely identify the alerts.

REQUEST TRACKER CONFIGURATION
    After the new ticket is created, the following is done:

    1. find all the other active tickets in the same queue( unless
    RT->Config->Get('ZabbixSearchAllQueues') is true, which will cause to
    search all the queues ) with the same values of $triggerstatus and
    $host.

    2. if RT->Config->Get('ZabbixMergeTickets') is true, merge all of them.
    if $triggerstatus is 'OK', resolve the merged ticket.

    if RT->Config->Get('ZabbixMergeTickets') is false and $triggerstatus is
    'OK', resolve all them.

    NOTE:

    config items like ZabbixSearchAllQueues and ZabbixMergeTickets can be
    set in etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm like this:

        Set($ZabbixSearchAllQueues, 1); # true
        Set($ZabbixMergeTickets, 0); # false, don't merge
        Set($ZabbixMergeTickets, 1); # merge into the newest ticket.
        Set($ZabbixMergeTickets, -1); # merge into the oldest ticket.

    by default, tickets will be resolved with status resolved, you can
    customize this via config item ZabbixResolvedStatus, e.g.

        Set($ZabbixResolvedStatus, "recovered");
